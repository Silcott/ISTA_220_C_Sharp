Chapter 5:
1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?
answer = answer + 42;
answer += 42;


2. List all the compound assignment operators.
variable = variable * number; 		variable *= number;
variable = variable / number; 		variable /= number;
variable = variable % number; 		variable %= number;
variable = variable + number; 		variable += number;
variable = variable - number; 		variable -= number;



3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
int i = 0;
while (i < 6)
{
Console.WriteLine(i);
i++;
}

Console.WriteLine(i);
i = i++;



int i = 50;
            while (i > 0 )
            {
                Console.WriteLine(i);
                i--;
            }

            Console.WriteLine(i);
            i = i--;
			
			
			
			
			

4. How long does a while loop run?
iterates through the fi le one line at a time until there are no more lines
available.



5. What is an iteration variable? (Not in book)
In programming languages that have a form of iteration loop such as a for loop or a foreach loop, then the iteration variable is the variable that is changed each iteration of the loop.

In C :

for(i=0;i<=MAX;i++)
  <code suite>
The variable ‘i’ is the iteration variable




6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?
Run forever



7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of
them? What happens if you omit all of them?
for (initialization; Boolean expression; update control variable) statement
You can omit any of the three parts of a for statement. If you omit the Boolean expression, it defaults to true, so the following for statement runs forever:
If you omit the initialization and update parts, you have a strangely spelled while loop:

8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
do




9. What does the break statement do?
to jump out of a switch statement. You can
also use a break statement to jump out of the body of an iteration statement. When you break
out of a loop, the loop exits immediately, and execution continues at the first statement that
follows the loop.




10. What does the continue statement do?
continue statement causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression



11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An
“infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these
kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
video games use them to pick up control movements or status updates of characters
